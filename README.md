# Installation

- Add the library to your project's dependencies
  - npm
    ```
    npm install --save @revenuecat/purchases-js
    ```
  - yarn
    ```
    yarn add --save @revenuecat/purchases-js
    ```

# Usage

See the [RevenueCat docs](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/web/revenuecat-billing) and the [SDK Reference](https://revenuecat.github.io/purchases-js-docs).

# Development

## Install the library in a local project

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies
- Build the library

```bash
npm install
npm run build:dev
```

To avoid publishing the package you can set it up as a local dependency.
In your testing project install the library as.

```bash
npm i /path/to/rcbilling-js
```

## Running tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Running linters

```bash
npm run test:typeCheck
npm run svelte-check
npm run prettier
npm run lint
```

## Running E2E tests

```bash
npm run build
cd examples/rcbilling-demo
npm run build
# In a different terminal or background the process
npm run dev
npm run test
```

## Update API specs

```bash
npm run extract-api
```

This will update the files in `api-report` with the latest public API.
If it has uncommited changes, CI tests will fail. Run this command and commit the changes if
they are expected.

# Publishing a new version

New versions are automated weekly, but you can also trigger a new release through CircleCI or locally
following these steps:

- Run `bundle exec fastlane bump` and follow the instructions
- A PR should be created with the changes and a hold job in CircleCI.
- Approve the hold job once tests pass. This will create a tag and continue the release in CircleCI
- Merge the PR once it's been released
