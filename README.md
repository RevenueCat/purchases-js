```

# Usage

## Download the current Offerings

By downloading the current Offerings you can easily build a Paywall page using the embedded Packages and their
associated `rcBillingProduct` and price.

```typescript
const appUserId = "the unique id of the user in your systems";
const purchases = new Purchases("your RC_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY");

purchases.getOfferings(appUserId).then((offerings) => {
  // Get current offering
  console.log(offerings.current);
  // Or a dictionary of all offerings
  console.log(offerings.all);
});
```

This should print the current offerings you have set up in your RC Account.

Please check out [this file](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-js/blob/main/src/entities/offerings.ts) for the
Offering's data structure

## Check User Entitlements

You can check the entitlements granted to your users throughout all the platforms, now
also on your website!

```typescript
const appUserId = "the unique id of the user in your systems";
const entitlementId = "the entitlementId you set up in RC";

const purchases = new Purchases("your RC_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY");

purchases.isEntitledTo(appUserId, entitlementId).then((isEntitled) => {
  if (isEntitled == true) {
    console.log(`User ${appUserID} is entitled to ${entitlementId}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`User ${appUserID} is not entitled to ${entitlementId}`);
  }
});
```

As example, you can build a cool React component with it:

```tsx
const WithEntitlement = ({ appUserId, entitlementId, children }) => {
  const [isEntitled, setIsEntitled] = useState<boolean | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const purchases = new Purchases("your RC_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY");
    purchases.isEntitledTo(appUserId, entitlementId).then((isEntitled) => {
      setIsEntitled(isEntitled);
    });
  }, [appUserId, entitlementId]);

  if (isEntitled === null) {
    return <>"loading..."</>;
  }

  if (isEntitled === true) {
    return <>{children}</>;
  }

  return <>You are not entitled!</>;
};
```

And then use it in your app:

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <>
    <WithEntitlement appUserId={"user12345"} entitlementId={"functionality5"}>
      <Functionality5 />
    </WithEntitlement>
  </>
);
```

If you need further information about the user's entitlements, you can use the `getCustomerInfo` method:

```ts
const customerInfo = await purchases.getCustomerInfo(appUserId);
```

### Important note

Please be aware that the information about the entitlements can be manipulated by malicious actors, so make sure
you protect your apps against attacks that modify the entitlements by validating access through your servers.

## Subscribe a User to an entitlement and allow payment with Stripe

RCBilling allows you to use your payment gateway for payments.
In this example we will show Stripe, more will be supported soon!

### Context

You built your paywall, and your user just clicked on the offer they want to subscribe to.

```tsx
const purchases = new Purchases("your RC_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY");
// You can retrieve the package from the offerings through `getOfferings`:
const rcBillingPackage = offerings.current.packages[0];
const appUserId =
  "the unique id of the user that wants to subscribe to your product";
const entitlementIdToCheck =
  "the entitlementId you set up in RC for your product"; // TODO: remove once this is not needed

purchase.purchasePackage(appUserId, rcBillingPackage).then((response) => {
  const isEntitled =
    entitlementIdToCheck in response.customerInfo.entitlements.active;
  if (isEntitled == true) {
    console.log(`User ${appUserID} is entitled to ${entitlementId}`);
  } else {
    console.log(
      `User ${appUserID} is not entitled to ${entitlementId}, even after ${numberOfAttempts} attempts`,
    );
  }
});
```

# Development

## Install the library in a local project

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies
- Build the library

```bash
npm install
npm run build:dev
```

To avoid publishing the package you can set it up as a local dependency.
In your testing project install the library as.

```bash
npm i /path/to/rcbilling-js
```

## Running tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Running linters

```bash
npm run test:typeCheck
npm run svelte-check
npm run prettier
npm run lint
```

## Update API specs

```bash
npm run extract-api
```

This will update the files in `api-report` with the latest public API.
If it has uncommited changes, CI tests will fail. Run this command and commit the changes if
they are expected.

## Update reference docs

```bash
npm run generate-docs
```

This will update the reference docs in the `docs` folder with the latest public API docs.
If it has uncommited changes, CI tests will fail. Run this command and commit the changes if
they are expected.

# Publishing a new version

- Update the version in `package.json`
- Add a new entry in `CHANGELOG.md` including all the PR merged and crediting the authors
- Commit the changes in main
- Create a new tag with the version number and push:

```
git tag v[version_number]
git push origin v[version_number]
```
